### High VRAM usage fix

Presently, there is a quirk in the NVIDIA drivers that affects niri's VRAM usage (the driver does not properly release VRAM back into the pool). Niri *should* use on the order of 100 MiB of VRAM (as checked in [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop)); if you see anywhere close to 1 GiB of VRAM in use, you are likely hitting this issue (heap not returning freed buffers to the driver).

Luckily, you can mitigate this with the [NVIDIA application profile](../../config/nvidia/50-limit-free-buffer-pool-in-wayland-compositors.json) in this repository. From the repository root, install it with:

```sh
sudo install -Dm644 config/nvidia/50-limit-free-buffer-pool-in-wayland-compositors.json /etc/nvidia/nvidia-application-profiles-rc.d/50-limit-free-buffer-pool-in-wayland-compositors.json
```

The profile sets `GLVidHeapReuseRatio=0` for the `niri` process. Compare the installed file with the tracked source using `cmp` to check for drift.

Restart niri after writing the config file to apply the change.

The upstream issue that this solution was pulled from is [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/issues/126#issuecomment-2379945259). There is a (slim) chance that NVIDIA updates their built-in application profiles to apply this to niri automatically; it is unlikely that the underlying heuristic will see a proper fix.

The fix shipped in the driver at the time of writing uses a value of 0, while the initial config posted by an Nvidia engineer approximately a year prior used a value of 1. 

### Screencast flickering fix

<sup>Until: 25.08</sup>

If you have screencast glitches or flickering on NVIDIA, set this in the niri config:

```kdl,must-fail
debug {
    wait-for-frame-completion-in-pipewire
}
```

This debug flag has since been removed because the problem was properly fixed in niri.
